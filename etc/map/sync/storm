This storm arose in response to variable solar-wind conditions that the Space Weather Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (SWPC, NOAA) associated with active region 2371 on the Sun. A series of 3 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originated from this active region. These were subsequently recorded by NASA\u2019s Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite, located on the Sun-Earth line at a distance approximately 1% of the distance from the Earth to the Sun, as abrupt enhancements in solar-wind velocity and density. With the arrival of the CMEs at the Earth on about June 21 16:45 UT, June 22 05:45 UT, and June 22 18:30 UT, concomitant increases in solar-wind ram pressure abruptly compressed the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere. These generated eastward-flowing magnetopause electric currents and positive perturbations in the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field recorded at low-latitude magnetic observatories around the world, including at USGS observatories in Guam, Honolulu, and San Juan.\n<\/p>\n<!--END: Snippet--> \n<p>\nAfter the arrival at Earth of the third CME, ACE data indicate that the solar wind\u2019s interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was southward directed, an orientation that is optimal for connection of the IMF onto geomagnetic field lines. Once this connection occurred, the magnetosphere was effectively opened up to the solar wind, allowing electrically charged, energetic particles to be deposited into the magnetotail and into the westward-flowing equatorial ring current of the inner magnetosphere. This process is recorded at low-latitude magnetic observatories as a general \u201cmain-phase\u201d diminishment in horizontal geomagnetic disturbance, the longitudinal average of which is the Dst index. This storm saw a maximum \u2013Dst of 195 nT, realized on June 23 at about 04:30 UT and, so, by this measure this storm was slightly smaller than the St. Patrick\u2019s day storm of March 17, 2015. Still, this storm is the second largest of this unusually subdued solar cycle. By comparison, in the last solar cycle, several storms had maximum \u2013Dst exceeding 300 nT, and one exceeded 400 nT. The mid-latitude magnetic activity index Kp reached a value of 8 (one less than the maximum of 9).\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAs was typical for an intense storm, geomagnetic activity was particularly intense at high latitudes. For example, at the Barrow observatory on the north shore of Alaska, magnetic declination varied by about 10 degrees over the course of this storm. Aurora were seen across Alaska, Canada, and many states in the lower continental United States.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nThe storm attracted media attention, including reports published by the Washington Post, CBS News, NBC News, National Geographic, and Slate.

The NOAA Kp index, a measure of mid-latitude magnetic activity, reached a value of 8, qualifying as a severe magnetic storm.

Concomitant solar-wind ram pressure abruptly compressed the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere. This generated eastward-flowing magnetopause electric currents and a positive perturbation in the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field recorded at low-latitude magnetic observatories around the world. In Figure 1 we show time series of the magnetic deviation from a quiet baseline in the northward (X), eastward (Y), and down (Z) directions, as well as the full-field (F), all obtained from the US Geological Survey magnetic observatory in Honolulu, HI. The relatively large (~50nT) sudden commencement is labeled \u201cSC\u201d in the figure.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAfter this, ACE data indicate that the solar wind\u2019s interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) was southward directed, an orientation that allows connection of the IMF onto northward pointing geomagnetic field lines. Once this connection occurred, the magnetosphere became strongly energetically coupled with the solar wind, enhancing the westward-flowing equatorial ring current of the inner magnetosphere. This process is generally recorded at low-latitude magnetic observatories as a diminishment in northward geomagnetic field, the longitudinal average of which is the Dst index. This storm saw a maximum \u2013Dst of 195 nT, realized on March 17 at 23:00 UT and, so, by this measure this storm was the largest of this unusually subdued solar cycle.

Joshua Rigler, USGS Geomagnetism Program<br \/>Prepared on September 15, 2014","narrative":"<p>\nOn 2014 September 9 and on September 10, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Space Weather Prediction Center (NOAA SWPC) reported the occurrence of two solar flares at a disk-centered sunspot active region on the Sun. At about the same time, a coronal mass (CME), a concentration of electrically-conducting solar-wind plasma, was ejected from the active region towards the Earth. This was followed on September 10 by an even more intense flare and energetic CME. In response to these observations, NOAA issued a warning for a magnetic storm commencing on September 12 and continuing into September 13. The first CME arrived at the Earth on 11 September at 23:47 UT (19:47 Eastern). In characteristic fashion, this was seen as a positive geomagnetic perturbation, or sudden commencement, as registered by low-latitude magnetometers operated by the Geomagnetism Program of the US Geological Survey (USGS); see the first \u201cSC\u201d for the San Juan magnetic observatory in the attached Figure (c). A geomagnetic sudden commencement is the result of compression of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere by the pressure of the solar wind. NOAA reported that the arrival of the first CME corresponded to solar wind velocity jumping from 400 km\/s to about 480 km\/s. The second CME arrived on 12 September at 15:57 UT (11:57 Eastern), and solar wind velocity jumped from 450 km\/s to about 620 km\/s. What followed over the next 24 hours was the normal main-phase of a magnetic storm: a west-ward-directed, equatorial magnetospheric electric current was activated, giving a characteristic depression in low-latitude magnetic disturbance, Figure (c). NOAA reported a Kp= 7 magnetic index, a generic measure of mid-latitude activity for a single 3-hr period, late on September 12, corresponding to a \u201cstrong\u201d magnetic storm. It is noteworthy that at high-latitudes, Figure (a), magnetic disturbance was, as normal for a magnetic storm, much greater in amplitude. This storm also produced beautiful displays of aurora at mid-latitudes, as reported by various media outlets, including National Public Radio (link) and Sky and Telescope (link). The Sun is presently near its 11-year solar-cycle sunspot maximum, and while this particular cycle is relatively weak compared to the past few, additional storms of intensity comparable or larger than this one can be expected over the next couple years.\n<\/p>\n\n<img src=\"\/downloads\/events\/Storm-20140912.png\" alt=\"CMO, BOU and SJG H data for 2014 September 11.\" width=\"768\" height=\"735\" \/>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/blogs\/thetwo-way\/2014\/09\/13\/348185814\/northern-lights-put-on-show-thanks-to-large-solar-flare\">http:\/\/www.npr.org\/blogs\/thetwo-way\/2014\/09\/13\/348185814\/northern-lights-put-on-show-thanks-to-large-solar-flare<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.skyandtelescope.com\/astronomy-news\/observing-news\/powerful-solar-flare-091020143\/\">http:\/\/www.skyandtelescope.com\/astronomy-news\/observing-news\/powerful-solar-flare-091020143\/<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\nUSGS Geomagnetism Program: <a href=\"http:\/\/geomag.usgs.gov\">geomag.usgs.gov<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\nIntermagnet data: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.intermagnet.org\">www.intermagnet.org<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\nNOAA Space Weather Prediction Center: <a href=\"http:\/\/swpc.noaa.gov\">swpc.noaa.gov<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\nNOAA Space Weather forecasts: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/forecast.html\">http:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/forecast.html<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\nNOAA Space Weather forecast archive: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/alerts\/archive\/alerts_Sep2014.html\">http:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/alerts\/archive\/alerts_Sep2014.html<\/a>\n<\/p>","featured":"0","pictures":[]},{"id":"18","updated":"2014-03-18 21:28:51","stormName":"19 February 2014","stormDate":"2014-02-19","dataStartTime":"1392681600","dataEndTime":"1393351200","suddenCommencementTime":"1392746400","suddenCommencementMagnitude":"0","mainPhaseTime":"1392799500","mainPhaseMagnitude":"-95","author":"E.

The first CME reached the Earth's magnetopause shortly after 03:00Z on Feb. 19, and in spite of a rather weak shock, its northward orientation drove a moderate (~15nT) positive impulse in Dst. As the CME's magnetic flux rope rotated, IMF reoriented southward, eroding the magnetopause, driving strong magnetospheric convection, and ultimately reducing USGS Dst to nearly -100nT for the storm's main phase. A subsequent northward turning of the IMF (possibly another small CME) encouraged a quick recovery, returning Dst more than halfway to ambient conditions within ~8 hours. The Space Weather Prediction Center's (SWPC's) estimated planetary K index (Kp) rose to 6 during this period.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nA second much stronger shock, likely associated with a solar filament eruption observed on February 18th, hit Earth's magnetopause shortly after 03:00Z on Feb. 20th. The IMF associated with the previous CME had been gradually weakening, and its orientation random, so the relatively strong (~25nT) positive impulse in Dst observed at 03:20Z was largely due to magnetopause (i.e., Chapman-Ferraro) currents. This was short-lived as IMF turned sharply southward, northward, then southward again, driving a double-dip storm-within-a-storm where USGS Dst fell back to -63nT and -75nT, respectively. IMF then returned to ambient conditions, and the geomagnetic storm (re)entered a slow recovery phase for almost 48 hours. Again, SWPC Kp rose to 6 during this period.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nFinally, a third, slow-moving CME, likely launched from the sun on February 20th, arrived at Earth shortly after 07:00Z on Feb. 23rd. Increased solar wind density and a weakly northward IMF orientation drove a moderate (~17nT) positive impulse, before the IMF reoriented southward, reducing main phase Dst to -50nT. SWPC Kp only rose to 4 during this period.\n<\/p>","featured":"0","pictures":[]},{"id":"17","updated":"2015-03-24 18:48:03","stormName":"1 June 2013","stormDate":"2013-06-01","dataStartTime":"1370044800","dataEndTime":"1370217600","suddenCommencementTime":"1370046600","suddenCommencementMagnitude":"41","mainPhaseTime":"1370070000","mainPhaseMagnitude":"-120","author":"","narrative":"The sudden commencement of this storm reached 41 nT, placing it in the 70th percentile (30% of storms have a larger sudden commencement).

The CME arrived at Earth on 22 January at 06:14 UT (02:15 Eastern). In characteristic fashion, this caused as a positive initial phase geomagnetic disturbance, which was registered by low-latitude USGS magnetic observatories and as recorded by the 4-station USGS storm-time disturbance index Dst. This initial phase is the signature of compression of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere by the pressure of the solar wind.

What followed over the next 24 hours was the normal main-phase of a small magnetic storm: a west-ward-directed, equatorial magnetospheric electric current was activated, giving a characteristic depression in low-latitude magnetic disturbance, with maximum depth of \u2013Dst = 66 nT at 23 January at 00:45. NOAA reported a Kp= 5 magnetic index, a generic measure of mid-latitude activity for a single 3-hr period on 22 January, corresponding to a \u201cminor\u201d magnetic storm. It is noteworthy that at high-latitudes magnetic disturbance can be much greater in amplitude and intensity.

This storm also produced beautiful displays of aurora at high latitudes. As we leave the quiet period of the last solar minimum and head into the next solar maximum, predicted for 2013, and over the next 3 years or so we can expect more storms, some of which will probably be much larger than the 23 January 2012 storm.<\/p>\n\n<p>\nOn 23 January, another solar flare and CME was observed.

If such a storm were to occur today, the economic impact to the United States because of disrupted technological systems could exceed $1 trillion (Baker et al., 2008).\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nUSGS Geomagnetic Dst: <a href=\"http:\/\/geomag.usgs.gov\/dst\/\">geomag.usgs.gov\/dst\/<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\nIntermagnet data: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.intermagnet.org\">www.intermagnet.org<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\nSolar images: National Solar Observatory <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nso.edu\/current_images.html\">http:\/\/www.nso.edu\/current_images.html<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\nNOAA Space Weather Prediction Center: <a href=\"http:\/\/swpc.noaa.gov\">swpc.noaa.gov<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\nNOAA Space Weather forecasts: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/forecast.html\">http:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\/forecast.html<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\nBaker, D.

The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center, having observed a solar flare and a \u201ccoronal mass ejection\u201d from an active region in the vicinity of a sunspot on Feb. 15, has forecast a 20% chance for a \u201cminor\u201d storm on Feb. 18. If such a storm occurs, it will be measured by the USGS geomagnetic observatory network, and USGS data will be used by both NOAA and the US Air Force to issue warnings so that mitigating steps can be taken by satellite and power-grid operators (among others). The Feb. 18 storm, if it occurs, can be expected to cause aurora that can be seen at night at high latitudes.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nFrom 2007 to about 2009, the sun was at a minimum in its 11-year cycle of variation. During this time, and as a result, geomagnetic activity was relatively quiescent. Now, however, we are in the midst of the early stages of a new solar cycle (number 24); solar activity, sunspot numbers, and geomagnetic activity have been increasing. We can expect that over the next few years, and especially at solar maximum around the years 2013 and 2014, that several large and potentially hazardous magnetic storms will occur.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nMagnetic storms result from the dynamic interaction of the solar wind and the coupled magnetospheric-ionospheric system of the Earth. Large magnetic storms represent a potential hazard for the activities and infrastructure of our modern, technologically based society. The possible effects of a large magnetic storm were the subject of a recent National Research Council report (Baker et al., 2008), which estimated that if a storm the size of the 1859 one were to occur today, damage to technological systems and resulting carry-on economic effects could cost the United States more than $1 trillion. Such storms can cause the loss of radio communication, reduce the accuracy of global-positioning systems, damage satellite electronics and affect satellite operations, increase pipeline corrosion, and induce voltage surges in electric power girds, causing blackouts. Even small storms can sometimes have surprising effects. A \u201csubstorm\u201d on April 5, 2010, resulted in the temporary loss of the Galaxy-15 communications satellite that operators are still trying to repair.\n<\/p>\n<p>\nBecause the practical effects of space weather are realized on, or just above, the surface of the Earth, ground-based sensor systems, including the magnetic observatories of the USGS, play an important role in space-weather monitoring (Love 2008). The intensity of the Feb. 14 event was measured by the USGS storm-time disturbance index, Dst (Gannon et al., 2011), derived from global observatory data, including those collected by the USGS; -Dst had a maximum \u201cmain-phase\u201d intensity of 30 nanoTesla (nT). For perspective, the largest storm of the 20th that of March 1989, had a maximum intensity of 525 nT, and the largest magnetic storm ever recorded, that of Sept. 1859, had a maximum intensity of about 1600 nT. While the Feb. 14 storm was quite small, and the Feb. 18 event may not be too much larger, both are reminders of what we can expect in the coming years, and the vital role of the USGS magnetic observatories.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\nAdditional Information:<br \/><br \/>\n\nReal-time data from the USGS observatories, including the Dst index, can be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/geomag.usgs.gov\">http:\/\/geomag.usgs.gov<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\nSpace weather predictions can be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov\">http:\/\/www.swpc.noaa.gov<\/a><br \/><br \/>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nap.edu\/catalog.php?\nrecord_id=12507\">Baker, D.

Months later, Intelsat continues to re-establish contact with the satellite, but it has begun to drift and the satellite, designed to operate through 2022, might end up being completely lost. The probable cause of the problem were a series of relatively small but unusual solar and geommagnetic events that commenced some 2 days earlier. On April 3, during relatively quiet solar conditions, a flare was observed near an active region on the surface of the Sun. Soon thereafter, a moderate-size coronal mass of hot plasma and tangled magnetic-field lines was ejected towards the Earth. Two days later, this ejection was detected by the ACE monitoring satellite situated between the Earth and the Sun. In response, NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center issued a forecast for slightly elevated levels of geomagnetic activity and space-weather disturbance. USGS magnetometers operated at ground-based observatories recorded the arrival of the coronal mass ejection on April 5, 2010, 08:45. A magnetic storm unfolded over the course of the next day, but USGS storm-time disturbance measures (Dst) showed that it never became very large. What was unusual about this event was a very abrupt magnetic-field reconfiguration, a magnetic substorm, that occurred just prior to the loss of contact with the Galaxy 15. USGS magnetic observatories in Alaska, California, Arizona, and Hawaii, as well as those operated by the Canadians, France, and New Zealand, showed that substorm activity was largely confined to eastern-Pacific longitudes \u2013 the same longitudinal position of the Galaxy 15. The substorm accelerated charged particles from the tail of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere. This probably caused a buildup of static electric charge on the Galaxy 15, which, when discharged either temporarily upset or permanently damaged electronic components in the satellite. Events like this normally occur during large magnetic storms, and we can expect an increase in their frequency during the up-and-coming solar maximum in 2013. That the Galaxy 15 anomaly occurred during modestly disturbed space-weather conditions highlights the necessity for both continuous real-time monitoring, such as that coordinated between the USGS and NOAA, and scientific research so that the hazardous effects of space-weather disturbance can be mitigated.\n<\/p>","featured":"0","pictures":[]}]
